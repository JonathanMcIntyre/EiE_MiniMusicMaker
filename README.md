# EiE_MiniMusicMaker
Developed for the Cortex-M3 / nRF51422 Razor Board 2 used in MPG/EiE. Mini Music Maker has two main modes of operation.  In its first mode, it can receive ANT wireless signals containing the information of a set of musical notes. It then displays the notes on the LCD and plays the notes using the buzzer. It can also go into a loading music state, where it will store the information it receives, i.e. many sets of notes, and will play all the sets of notes continuously when it exits from the loading music state.  In its second mode, it behaves like a musical instrument, where the user can choose the note to play with the vertical captouch slider and sound the note using button one.
